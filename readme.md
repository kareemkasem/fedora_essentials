## What the script is for:
1. enable rpm fusion
2. install all media codecs
3. install some essential programs like brave, local send and flatseal
4. install gnome quality extensions (require manual enabling)
5. optional node stack config (mongodb, node, webstrom)

## key considerations:
1. this script will install and configure flatpak and would install flatpak packages 
2. ensure the script is excutable if not run
```
cd /folder/containing/script
sudo chmod u+x ./fedorainit.sh
```
3. run script as `sudo`
```
sudo ./fedorainit.sh
```
4. this scriptd is written for the Gnome desktop environment
5. this script will be updated in the future
